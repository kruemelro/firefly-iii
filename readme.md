## About

This is a fork of James Cole's great Firefly III Project. I created this fork to reflect the strategy <b>"Give every Dollar a job (gedaj)". </b><br>
I removed the balance feature from the dashboard and created a "cleaned Net Worth". It is calculated as follows:

current Balance + planed Incomes - Budgets - open Bills

So you dont have a single Dollar on your main account which is not needed. 

<b>At the moment its only a very quick and dirty solution for myself. </b>
